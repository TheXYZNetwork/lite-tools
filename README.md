# Lite-Tools
A stripped-down and simplistic set of building tools, designed for DarkRP.

## What is Lite-Tools?
Lite-Tools is a lightweight and simplistic take on a handful of infamous and commonly used building tools in gamemodes like DarkRP. It provides replacements for:
- [Precision](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104482086) | Push/Pull, Rotate & Snap.
- [Shadow Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1274272415)
- [Stacker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=264467687)
- [3D2D Text Screens](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109643223)

Although all these tools work well and are easy to use, they often come with a wide range of features. Lite-Tools strips their ideas down to the core.

## So what exactly does Lite-Tools provide?
Lite-Tools provides the following tools:
- **Push/Pull** | Push or pull a prop. Who'da guessed.
- **Rotate** | Rotate a prop around all 3 axis.
- **Shadow Remover** | Remove shadows from a prop.
- **Snap** | Snap a prop to the closest Nth degree.
- **Stacker** | Stack props super high.
- **Text Placement** | Simple 3D2D text.

## Contributions
I encourage you to contribute to this. If it's a small bug fix or a crash exploit, all contributions are welcome. If you spot a better way of doing something, submit it! The best way to improve stuff is through collaboration.

## Credits
It is important to note that snippets from the original addons were used in some places. And ofc, the idea came from them too. 
Pretty much all the systems use some snippet or other from the original system. From memory, some of the [Precision](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=104482086) based tools use snippets, for example, push/pull uses some precision code for getting the direction to move. The [Shadow Remover](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1274272415) tool also uses the same method in the already existing addon.
